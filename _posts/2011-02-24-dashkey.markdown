Work Items:
---------------------

![](/images/feature_icon.png)
Feature – A feature is the most common work item, and refers to a desired feature of something you are working on. For example if we are organizing an event together, a feature might be a great dancing band or blue invitations.

![](/images/bug_icon.png) Bug – A bug is a work item in which something needs to be fixed. For example if there are edits that need to be made to an existing document or a bug in software needs to be fixed.

![](/images/chore_icon.png) Chore – A chore is a work item in which a task must be completed. An example might be a list of people that need to be called or a piece of code that needs to be implemented.

![](/images/gift_icon.png) Gift – A gift is an item that is created to award someone credits for a job well done. This is often used when someone has gone above and beyond in their work and the community decides to recognize and award them for it.

![](/images/expense_icon.png) Expense – This is a item that is used for making decisions about expenses of the project.

![](/images/recurring_icon.png) Recurring – This is a work item that is recurring, meaning that once it is completed, it will come back to the Open queue automatically.




Estimation:
---------------------

![](/images/estimate-quest.png) Estimation needed -When you have not yet estimated an item, you will see the "Estimate?"" button and it indicates that you need to estimate the item. An item cannot move from New to Open unless someone has estimated it.

![](/images/dice_No.png) Estimation needed – When you have not yet estimated an item, you will see this ? and it indicates that you need to estimate the item. You will see other people’s estimates and the overall average once you have estimated the item yourself.

![](/images/dice_wait.png) "Don't Know" - When you have selected "I Don't Know" as your estimate, you will see this. An item cannot move from New to Open unless someone has estimated it, and Don't Know does not count as an estimate, therefore you may need to wait for another person to estimate for the item to move forward. 

![](/images/dice_3.png) Average Complexity or Credits – If you are working in a workstream with credits, this dice is a visual representation of the number of credits that the item has been estimated at. If your workstream is volunteer or not using credits, this is merely an indication of the level of complexity. Click here for more information about estimation.
