This is a guide to starting a new workstream. If you want to know generally about workstreams, click here.

To start a new workstream:
1. Visit your [homepage](http://secure.bettermeans.com/welcome)
2. Click "[New Workstream](http://secure.bettermeans.com/projects/new)" and this will bring you to the New Workstream page, clever huh?
3. Give your workstream a cool name
4. Don't forget the description, this will be the first impression of your organization
5. Decide if this is public or private. To make a private workstream, uncheck the Public box, for more discussion of the tradeoffs, click here
6. Decide if this is a volunteer workstream, meaning that ALL work completed is volunteer.
7. Upload your logo or image URL
8. Decide which modules you want. We know that this might be confusing, therefore we are providing information below on what each of these modules are.
9. Click save and you are ready to roll.

Item Tracking: This is the essential element of the platform in that it allows you to track all work items using the dashboard and item views. However one situation in which you might turn this off is if you are creating a root workstream for your organization and you are planning on creating lots of subworkstreams where all the work and item tracking would take place. Un-checking item tracking would leave the other elements such as discussion and wiki but without the dashboard or item tracking.

News: This module allows you to check out or report on the latest news. News is used to broadcast events to your team. For example winning a bid, or a new product release.

Documents: This module allows you to upload documents to share with your team.

Wiki: Wikis are great tools for collaboration and therefore we provide the option for each workstream to have a wiki. Wikis are essentially online documents and everyone that has access can not only read but also edit and improve online.

Discussion: This module creates a discussion board for your workstream and like so many discussion boards before it, you can talk about stuff here. If someone has an idea that they are not yet ready to propose as a motion or work item and want to talk to folks about it, they can start a new topic. You might use the discussion board to discuss general strategy, new possible workstream, new target audience, or anything that comes to mind.

Motions: Motions are used to make large important decisions that are project-wide. This is a democratic mechanism to make decisions together. There are different types of motions, to learn more about motions click here.

Credits: Credits are a more open and democratic way of valuing work and awarding compensation. We are really excited about offering this as an option and we strongly encourage you to learn more about credits. If you choose to use Credits for your workstream, a set of scales will appear and you should choose from those scales. You are able to change this setting after you have created the workstream.
