The activity stream is a news feed of all of the activity in a workstream. Any new items, changes to items, status changes, comments, wiki edits, news, member changes and more are in the activity stream.

From the Activity stream you can click on the title of any item and it will open up a lightbox (window within the window) with all the detailed information about that particular item. From the lightbox you can contribute and take action on the item. Then you can close the lightbox and you are back where you were in the activity stream, pretty nifty really.

Why should I use the Activity Stream?
-------------------------------------

The Activity stream gives you a good sense of the most recent activity in the project. If you have been gone for an hour or a week, you can use the activity to see what has happened since you last logged in. Also, combined with the lightbox, you are able to not only see what has been happening but you can respond to and participate in the work.

What is the logic in what is included in the Activity Stream?
-------------------------------------------------------------

There is an activity stream for every workstream and it aggregates downward. What this means is that when you are looking at the activity, you'll see the breadcrumbs at the top left that indicates what part of the project you are looking at. For example, you might be looking at a subworkstream of the overall project, this means that you are only seeing the activity for that subworkstream. However the activity stream aggregates downward, meaning that if you are looking at the Activity for a workstream that has 3 subworkstreams, the activity will show all the activity for the workstream AND its 3 subworkstreams - thus aggregating downward. Important to note is that while the Activity aggregates downward, the [Dashboard](/dashboard) does not.

In terms of what is included in the Activity stream, pretty much everything. Anything that is modified in the workstream and all its work items shows up in the Activity, EXCEPT voting, prioritizing and estimating. The reason for this is that there is a lot of voting, prioritizing and estimating that will happen and we did not want to flood the activity with that information. 

However if an item moves from New to Open because enough people have voted and estimated, this status change will appear. Here is a list of the different items that WILL show up in the Activity Stream:

* Change in status of an item (as described above), for example from New to Open
* Creation of a new work item
* Comments on any work item
* New motion is created
* Motion passes
* New membership nomination
* New clearance granted to private workstream
* News posted about the project
* Updates to work items, for example an attachment is added or an item is moved to a different workstream
* Ownership of a task is taken by a team member
* Completion of a task
* Wiki edits

Things that will NOT show up in the activity stream:

* Votes (Agree, Disagree, Accept, Reject, etc)
* Prioritization
* Estimation of complexity/cost of work items
* A [retrospective](/retros) starting or ending (look to notifications for this)
* [Credits](/credits) being awarded to you or anyone (look to notification for credits awarded to you)


Can I sort the activity?
------------------------

Not yet. Right now Activity is sorted according to the logic above. However we recognize how useful it would be to be able to sort the activity stream according to your preference and we are therefore working on it. Check back soon.
