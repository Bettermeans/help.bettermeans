A notification is a message to you from the system and is important to pay attention to. You will receive notifications if you:

* become a [member](/membership) of a workstream
* gain clearance to a [private workstream](/workstreams)
* are included in a [retrospective](/retros) and therefore need to cast your vote
* are included in a [retrospective](/retros) that has ended - find out the final assessment
* receive [credits](/credits), yay!

How will I know that I have a notification?
-------------------------------------------

When you sign in, or when you are on any page of the site, look to the upper right corner of the window to find the notifications. If you have any notifications, they will appear here, if you see none, then you have no notifications.
