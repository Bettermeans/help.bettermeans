How much does Bettermeans cost?
----------------------

Well, it depends, naturally. We are excited about transparency and therefore we do not charge for public workstreams. You get unlimited public workstreams and public users, meaning you can work/play as much as you want with whomever you want if it is all [public](/workstreams). 

However, if you prefer privacy for your work and you only want those that you invite to come work with you, then you must pay for our private service. We have a bucketed pricing structure depending on the number of private workstreams and private users. All paying plans get a Free 30 Day trial.

[Pricing and Sign up](http://bettermeans.com/front/pricing.html)


What are the limitations on the free account?
----------------------
When you sign up for the free plan, all of your work is public and transparent. We think this is a great thing that will allow a community to develop around you and bring a richness to your work, which is why we are offering it for free. There is a 10GB soft limit on the amount of storage, the reason it is soft is because we are not policing this too closely but we need to protect ourselves from major offenders.


Do I have to sign a long term contract?
----------------------
No. Bettermeans is a pay-as-you-go service. There are no contracts or commitments on your part. Simply pay month-to-month. Cancel anytime, and you'll be billed only for the current month.


What type of payment do you accept?
----------------------
We only accept payments online. You can use all major credit cards (Visa, Mastercard, and American Express). We do not accept Paypal.


How does the 30-day trial work?
----------------------
If you cancel a paying plan within 30 days of signing up you won’t be charged a thing. Refunds can not be issued after your initial 30 day trial and we don’t prorate for partial months.


Do I get a 30-day trial if I upgrade?
----------------------
If you upgrade from a free account to a pay account you are not eligible for the 30-day free trial. The 30-day free trial on paying plans only applies if you sign up for a paying plan now. You can always downgrade later if you choose.


Can I switch from a paying account to a free account? What happens to my private workstreams?
----------------------
Yes, you can switch from your account page. However, if you have private workstreams, there will need to be a change in order to maintain those workstreams. You'll have 2 options,

* to keep the workstream private, you will need to transfer ownership of the workstream to another person who has an account with allowances for private workstreams
* OR, the workstream can become a public workstream


Why should I pay for Bettermeans?
----------------------
If you are interested in keeping your work private and your team limited to those you invite, then paying for Bettermeans service is the best way to go. Also, if you are just really excited about this (r)evolution of work, we are happy for you to pay in order to support our work - that would make us feel loved and appreciated.

Can I change my plan?
----------------------
Yes. When you are signed into Bettermeans, look to the upper right corner for "account", click on that to take you to your account page and you’ll see your options.


How will I know when I need to change my plan?
----------------------
If you have reached any of your limits (users, workstreams, or data storage) you will receive an email notification. From this notification there will be a link to follow to change your plan.


Can I change my email address?
----------------------
Yes, you can change your email address by going to your Account page (see upper right corner for link)

* Then under your email is a link that says "Change"
* Enter your new email address
* Confirm from the email sent to you
* And your email address is changed


How secure is my information?
----------------------
All credit card transactions are processed using secure encryption, the same level of encryption used by banks. Credit card information is transmitted, stored, and processed securely on a [PCI Compliant network](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payment_Card_Industry_Data_Security_Standard).
