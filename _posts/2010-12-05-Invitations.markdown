We are excited for you to invite others to join you in your work.

Important to note: 
* You can only invite people to a root workstream. Their membership in a workstream applies to all sub-workstreams as well. In other words, a person can't belong to a sub-workstream, and not belong to its parent workstream.
* Only members access the invite interface, however you can ask a member for an invitation link (see below), that you can send to people


Here's how to invite others:
----------------------
There are many places on the site where you can invite people, but to demonstrate a few:

From the Team tab:
* there is an orange button on the right "Invite people" OR
* at the bottom of the team list is a link to "Invite others"

From the Workstream Overview:
* there is an orange button on the right "Invite people" OR
* at the bottom of the team list on the right is a link to "Invite others"


In the invite interface, you have 2 options for inviting people
1.Use an invitation code: this code will specifically invite people to become a contributor of your workstream. You can paste this into your own personalize email or post it to a website. OR
2.Send an invitation through our platform:
* enter up to 50 email addresses
* choose what level that you want to invite them to (Contributor, Member, Core Team, etc)
* either use our standard message or insert your personalized message
* Click "Send Invitations" 

Once the invite is sent, those people will be automatically invited to the Workstream from which you invited them.

* If a person doesn't yet have an BetterMeans account, first they will be prompted to sign up. Then once they have an account with BetterMeans they will have access to the Workstream that you have invited them to.
* If a person already has a BetterMeans account, they will receive a notification indicating that they have access to your workstream 


Still have questions? We are working to constantly improve this site, therefore PLEASE email us with your additional questions at support@bettermeans.com.
