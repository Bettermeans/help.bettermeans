Testing that a webhook works can be a bit of a pain.  Thankfully with the help of "PostBin":http://www.postbin.org/ the pain can be avoided.

h2. When hooks are fired

First and foremost, webhooks are not always called when a push is made.  Currently hooks only fire when a branch that exists on GitHub is modified.  Pushing new branches, deleting branches, and creating tags will not fire a webhook.  Forced pushes such as @git push origin master --force@ may not predictably call hooks as well.  To ensure your commits are sent to your webhook, always push the branch when it is created before you commit.  This way the branch exists on GitHub when you push the commits you want sent to the webhook.

h2. Setting up

First, visit "PostBin":http://www.postbin.org/ and click "Make a PostBin".  Copy the URL you are sent to:

!http://img.skitch.com/20091118-jp5jt8gtcxy8dn2w3kk1xkpt8j.jpg!

Paste this URL into your repo's post-receive URLs setting and save:

h2. Testing the hook is fired

To test that the hook fires we need an existing branch on the GitHub repo.  In this example we create a new repo, push one commit, then make another commit and push it.  We only expect the second push to be sent to our PostBin.

<pre class="terminal">[tekkub@tekBook: ~/tmp] $ mkdir test_post
[tekkub@tekBook: ~/tmp] $ cd test_post
[tekkub@tekBook: ~/tmp/test_post] $ git init

[tekkub@tekBook: ~/tmp/test_post master+] $ git commit -m 'second commit'

Now that we've pushed a commit that should be sent to our webhook, lets check if it did by reloading our PostBin page:

Success!
