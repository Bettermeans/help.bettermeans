Estimation is the way in which an item is assessed by the team. Every member of a team has a chance to estimate an item while it is new or open. The final estimation is the average of all the member votes. Estimation means different things based on whether [credits](/credits) are being used or not.
If Credits are being used: The estimation is the value of the work item to the project. In other words, how much a person/team will be paid for completing the item.
If Credits are not being used or it is a Volunteer Project Workstream: The estimation is based on the level of complexity of the item.

How can I estimate an item?
---------------------------

You can estimate an item by clicking on the ![](/images/dice_NO.png) from the item view or dashboard, and then selecting your assessment of the value/complexity.

What do the dice mean?
----------------------
The dice are a quick visual indicator of the current average estimate for an item. Depending on the scale chosen at the [creation of the project workstream](/workstreamguide), the dice may have different values, but the dice are an indicator of relative values within a project workstream. Here is an example of different dice values, you will have this view when you estimate an item.

How is the final estimation determined?
---------------------------------------
The final estimation is an average of all the member's estimates. Each member's vote is weighted equally.  Members may estimate an item while it is New or Open, and the value/complexity is fixed once an item is started.

What if I am unsure of my estimate?
-----------------------------------
Remember that when you estimate an item, it has an impact upon people's compensation, and with great power comes great responsibility. You have to use your best judgment when you estimate an item. If you are very unsure, don't estimate, you don't have to. You have the option to leave the estimation to those who are more sure of the value of the work. Also, if you estimate an item and then change your mind for whatever reason, you can change your estimate.

Why isn't my estimation being factored in?
------------------------------------------

It is possible for you to estimate items even if you are not a [member](/membership), meaning that you are a user or contributor, but your vote is not binding and is not factored into the estimate of the item. As a user or contributor, your estimate is visible to the members and may influence their estimate, but it is not part of the final calculation.

When is the estimation final?
-----------------------------
The estimate of an item is final when someone starts the item. Therefore members may estimate items while they are in the New or Open queue.

Why can't I see what other people have estimated?
-------------------------------------------------
In order to see other people's estimates, you must first estimate the item yourself. This results in better crowdsourcing of a fair value for the item, and prevents anchoring a range in someone's mind before they add their estimate.

Why use estimation?
-------------------

In the interest of working as democratically as possible, estimation is a way for every voice to be heard. Since every member has a chance to estimate an item, work is valued more fairly. In addition, when a person starts an item, they know exactly what it is valued at. In the use of credits, estimation paired with retrospectives comprise the new more fair and democratic form of compensation that BetterMeans is offering to the world.

What impact does my estimation have?
------------------------------------

If you are a member, your estimate is counted equally towards the value/complexity of a item as every other members estimate. When you estimate an item in the New queue, your estimate may indicate the speed at which an item can advance because items of greater value/complexity will take more votes to advance to the Open queue ([More information on how items move.](/dashboard)) In addition, the value of the item is what a person/team will be paid all together for an item, therefore you want to take that into consideration when estimating an item.
