A Workstream is our lingo for a group or set of work. A workstream could be a department of your organization or it could be a specific project that you are working on by yourself or with others. For information on how to start a workstream, click here.

What is a Project Subworkstream?
--------------------------------

A project subworkstream is the same concept as a workstream, but it is nested within a workstream. For example, if your workstream is a department, then a project subworkstream might be a specific project within the department. If your workstream is a project, then a project subworkstream might be a specific area of expertise within the project.

What is a Private Workstream?
-----------------------------

When you are creating a workstream, if you uncheck the "public" box, then you are creating a private workstream. Access to a private workstream is determined by the creator of that workstream. A private workstream is not viewable by anyone other that those that are granted clearance for that workstream and if someone searches for the private workstream they will not find it. But important to note is that you have to pay for private workstreams, for specifics see the pricing page.

What is a Public Workstream?
----------------------------

When you create a workstream, the "public" box is checked by default and if you leave it so, you are creating a public workstream. Public workstreams are available for anyone to see, comment on, contribute to. By creating a public workstream, you are opening up the possibility for like-minded individuals to find you and engage with you on your work. We are excited about openness and transparency and the richness that it can bring to all of our work â€“ hence why we are allowing people to start unlimited public workstreams for free. Go forth and collaborate openly and democratically.

Can I change a Workstream from Public to Private?
-------------------------------------------------

Yes, it is possible to change a public workstream or project subworkstream into a private workstream, and this can be accomplished by the admin or through a motion. When this happens, every team member automatically gains clearance, and contributors have to be granted clearance manually.

How do I delete a workstream?
-----------------------------

So far you can't. We're working on it.

Can I merge two different workstreams into one?
-----------------------------------------------

No, for now you cannot merge two workstreams, but its a good idea and we are working on it.

Can I export my data?
---------------------

Yes. Go to your account page, and scroll to the bottom. You should see a data dump link where you can download all issues related to workstreams that you started.
