What is the Dashboard?
----------------------

The dashboard is a central point of the BetterMeans platform and allows you to see all of the work items in a project workstream. From the Dashboard you have an overview of the status of all the items in a project workstream and you also have the ability to take action on items. Here is what the Dashboard looks like, once you get working.

This probably looks overwhelming and also a bit exciting. We are going to help you understand how to work with this interface and feel familiar and liberated by this tool. Also note, that the Dashboard above is a particularly busy project workstream these days, and other Dashboard might look simpler, like this one. It all depends on how you are working.

What is included in the Dashboard?
----------------------------------

The Dashboard includes all work items. Work items are any item that has been proposed to be completed. Work items could include; bugs, features, expenses, recurring tasks, chores, or gifts (for more detail on these, click here). Motions and discussions are not included in the Dashboard.

Also important to note is that each project workstream and project subworkstream has its own Dashboard and does NOT aggregate downward. For example, in the two dashboards displayed above you'll notice by the breadcrumbs in the upper left corner that the first Dashboard is for the Website Platform project workstream, while the second Dashboard is for the Help Site, which is a project subworkstream of the Website Platform. Each of these has separate dashboards and work items, meaning that the Help Site work items DO NOT appear in the Website Platform Dashboard. Therefore to see all the work items you want to dig into each project workstream and project subworkstream.


How is the Dashboard used?
--------------------------

The Dashboard is not only a good place to see an overview of all the work, but you can take action directly from the dashboard. You can create an item, vote, estimate, prioritize, start, join, finish, and accept or reject an item. For more information on each of these actions, see below.

From the dashboard you can also open up a lightbox (a window within the window), where you can see the details of an item, including: full history, discussion, status, creator, owner, and more. Also from the lightbox, you can take all the actions that you would in the dashboard, voting, estimation, etc. The nice part about the lightbox is that when you are done, you can close the lightbox and you are back on the Dashboard where you left off. Here is what the lightbox view looks like.

What do all the little icons mean?
----------------------------------

So glad that you asked, we have conveniently assembled a detailed key of all the things that you see in the Dashboard, just click here.

How do I create an item?
------------------------

You can create an item in the Dashboard by clicking the "New Item" button along the tab bar OR in the first row of the New Queue.

How do I vote on an item?
-------------------------

You can vote on an item by clicking the orange Agree? button...

When you click on this you will be given options and you can cast your vote. For more detail on what the different option mean, click here.

How do I estimate an item?
--------------------------

You can estimate an item by clicking on the
 , and then selecting your assessment of the value/complexity. For more information on estimation, click here.

How do I prioritize items?
--------------------------

To prioritize the item, click the dot or arrow to the right of the voting button for each item. You can then see how others have prioritized it and you can indicate what priority you would give it by selecting Up, Neutral, or Down.

How can I start an item?
------------------------

Items can be started from the Open queue. To start an item click on the blue "Start" button. Anyone with access to your project workstreams can start an item, however once an item is finished, the work can be accepted or rejected. Items in the top 3 priority levels or with 0 dice value are able to be started.

Can I join an item that has already been started?
-------------------------------------------------

Yes, you can join an item that has been started by another person by clicking on the blue "Join" button when an item is in the In Progress queue.

Can I add someone to an item I own?
-----------------------------------

Yes, if you are the owner of an item you can both add people and remove people from your team for this particular work item. To do this, open up the lightbox view of an In Progress Item. On the right side of the lightbox, Under "Joined By" there is a link to "+Add Someone". Then select from the Drop down menu of the members and contributors to the enterprise. If you do not see the person you are looking for, you need to invite them to the project workstream first, for tips on inviting people, click here.

Similarly, if you want to remove someone, go to the same place in the lightbox and there will be a "remove" link next to each person's name.

Can anyone vote/estimate/prioritize?
------------------------------------

Yes, anyone who has access to your project workstream can vote, estimate or prioritize. However, only the votes of the members will be binding. All votes/estimates/priorities of contributors will be non-binding. The non-binding votes will appear in the record, however they will not be factored into the advancement, estimation or prioritization. The only votes that will make an impact will be the binding votes. This system allows you to get a sense of the larger community's opinion, however ultimately you and your team members are the ones that determine the direction of the project.

Can anyone create an item?
--------------------------

Yes, anyone can create an item. And trust us, this is great. This means that you are able to capture everyone's ideas, both good and bad. But your team then gets to vote on what is a good idea and what is a high priority. This feature will bring richness and diversity of perspective to your work.

How can an item be canceled?
----------------------------

If an item has had no activity for 30 days the "Cancel" button appears and this item can then be canceled by any member.

How can I search for something in the Dashboard?
------------------------------------------------

On every Dashboard you have the ability to search within that dashboard for a particular item. If you are thinking of creating a new item, but think that one might already exist, this would be a good time to use the search feature. You'll see a white box in the upper right corner of the Dashboard that says "Fast Search". If you type in this box, the search results will appear in the Dashboard in their appropriate queue, with the search terms highlighted, pretty great really.

You can clear the search by clicking the words "clear" at the center top of the dashboard after you have searched for something.

What is the "Filter (show all)"?
--------------------------------

These are a set of super nifty filters that allow you sort everything on the dashboard by useful views, such as Items that I didn't touch, Needs my agreement, Updated in last week, and Only show Bugs. Check out the options in the drop down (note that there are more than pictured here, you'll have to see for yourself and scroll down on the options to see everything). And when you are done, you can go back to the full view by selecting "Filter (show all)".

What control is there over the work?
------------------------------------

Control is exercised by the team as they vote on items. Every team member gets an equal voice on this platform, and you all manage each other. While anyone can create an item and anyone can start an item, you and your team control what works is open to be started and also whether work is accepted or rejected. Quality is controlled in the end product through the accept and reject. In addition, if you are the owner of a work item, you have control over who is on your team. In this democracy of ideas, great ideas can come from anywhere and the team drives the project forward and you truly work together to make it all happen.

How do items advance from one queue to the next?
------------------------------------------------

The short answer is that items move when there are more agrees than againsts or more accepts than rejects, and the speed at which they move depends on the value/complexity with the smaller items moving faster. But of course it is more complicated than that.

The more detailed answer...

Voting on the Dashboard functions using lazy majority. Lazy majority is a vote that is open for 3 days and at the end of the 3 days if there are more yes' than no's than an item advances. This means that those who show up to vote, drive the direction of the work, and there is no waiting for unanimity. The exception to the 3 days of waiting are:

* if the majority of active members on that project workstream have voted yes, than the item advances before the 3 days are up
* if the difference between yes and no votes is greater than half the # on the dice.
* when someone Blocks an item - this stops an item and any member has that power. But a block requires an explanation, and should be used with respect. 


<div class="terminal">
examples<br>
<ul>
  <li>4 active members and 3 have voted yes in day 1, then the item moves forward</li>
  <li>if an item is estimated at 3 dice complexity, and 2 members have voted yes, than the item advances</li>
  <li>if an item is estimated at 6 dice value, and 5 members voted yes and 1 voted no, the difference is 4 which is greater than 6/2=3, therefore the item advances.</li>
  <li>if an item is estimated at 1 dice value, only one person needs to vote yes and it advances</li>
</ul>
</div>

_Note - the above logic applies to voting agree/against when an item is New or Open OR when an item is Done and needs to be accepted/rejected. Therefore a yes vote would be agree or accept, and a no vote would be against or rejected._
